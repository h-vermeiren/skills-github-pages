# My special sauce
- Follow the latest technology and apply it creatively 
    -as soon as Langchain, Langgraph and ChatGPT were available, used it to build research Agents that can autonomously make drug target assessment files in minutes
- Give the data back with insights added on top
    - nobody know the data better than the people producing it, the operators of IVD devices, the Cocoon operator: give them the tools to explore the data
    - make it interactive, nobody reads a 10 pager with lots of graphs, but actively exploring your own data excites most people, and leads to insights
    - don't spend time on Shiny, streamlit dahsboards if you have Spotfire, Tableau, Qlik or PowerBI available
